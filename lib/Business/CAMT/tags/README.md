# Abbreviation table

The abbreviations.pdf files is loaded from

This file was converted into lib/Business/CAMT/xsd/abbreviations.csv via
cut-n-paste from the evince PDF reader.

Many, many abbreviations are missing from that list, so added manually.
I did not understand all abbreviations, so still some work to do.  Help me
complete the list.  (3 to go, out of 1343)
For this, https://www.mx-message.com is a great help (even with its older
and limited number of messages)

Some short versions have stayed. Those made some names increadably long, without
adding much clarity:
* Id for Identification (abstract code)  This is not in the database 'id' sense, which is 'code' in these schemes
* Ind for Indicator (flags existence)
* NAV for Net Asset Value
